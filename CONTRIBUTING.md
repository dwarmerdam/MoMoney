# Contributing

MoMoney is a **template repository**. It is not a collaborative open-source
project — there is no team of maintainers reviewing pull requests.

## How to Use This Project

1. Click **"Use this template"** on GitHub to create your own private copy.
2. Customize the YAML config files in `config/` for your bank accounts and
   spending categories.
3. Deploy with Docker on your own hardware.

See [README.md](README.md) and [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for full instructions.

## Bug Reports and Ideas

If you find a bug in the template code or have a suggestion, you're welcome to
open an issue. However, there is no guarantee of a response or fix — this is a
personal project shared as a template for others to build on.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are **disabled**. If you've made improvements in your own copy
that you think would benefit the template, open an issue describing the change
instead.

## Your Own Copy

Once you create your own copy from this template, it's yours. Modify it however
you like — the [MIT License](LICENSE) places no restrictions on what you can do
with the code.
